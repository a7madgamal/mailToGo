    To Whom It May Concern,

I am deeply troubled by the abduction and abuse of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, by the Israeli Defense Forces. Since October 5th, 2024, I have followed Dr. Hussam’s updates amid the genocide and ethnic cleansing in North Gaza.

Recently, Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital after bombing it, violating international law and human rights. Eyewitnesses report that medical staff were tortured and stripped, with some released but Dr. Hussam and others taken to an unknown location.

The murder of Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh in Ofer Prison, as reported by the OHCHR, underscores the urgency of Dr. Hussam’s release. It is unacceptable that human rights are being ignored. We demand you pressure Israel to release Dr. Hussam and the hospital staff immediately.

Best regards,`,
